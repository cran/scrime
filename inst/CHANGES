##############
Version 1.1.6

Fixed a wrong explanation in the man page for simulateSNPs.


##############
Version 1.1.5

Added an argument vec.cat to simulateSNPs that allows to generate
data with a categorical response.


##############
Version 1.1.4

Added the argument withRef to simulateSNPcatResponse.


##############
Version 1.1.3

Added a require to buildSNPannotation.

Version 1.1.2

Moved buildSNPannotation and shortenSNPdescription from siggenes to
scrime.

for their usage in siggenes.


##############
Version 1.1.1

Just a few bug fixes in the new Rd-files.


##############
Version 1.1.0

Added several functions for rowwise computations of statistics (tables,
frequencies, correlations, Cochran-Armitage trend test, ...) which are
partly based on contingency tables.


##############
Version 1.0.7

Fixed a bug in scrime_internal.Rd.


##############
Version 1.0.6

In replaceNAs, threshold for assuming that two variables are equal lowered 
(from 10^-5) to 10^-8.

Fixed a bug in rowChisqStats concerning the p-value computation for constant
variables.


##############
Version 1.0.5

Added man page for simulateSNPcatResponse.

Added function showChanges for showing this file in R.


##############

Now pcc2Mats will also work correctly if a row of x1 and a row of x2 are 
identical.


##############
Version 1.0.1

Added (internal function) check4Monomorphism to check for variables only 
showing one level in knncatimpute and knncatimputeLarge.
