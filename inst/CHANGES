Version 1.1.2

Moved buildSNPannotation and shortenSNPdescription from siggenes to
scrime.

Added the argument sameNull to rowChisq2Class and rowChisqMultiClass
for their usage in siggenes.


##############
Version 1.1.1

Just a few bug fixes in the new Rd-files.


##############
Version 1.1.0

Added several functions for rowwise computations of statistics (tables,
frequencies, correlations, Cochran-Armitage trend test, ...) which are
partly based on contingency tables.


##############
Version 1.0.7

Fixed a bug in scrime_internal.Rd.


##############
Version 1.0.6

In replaceNAs, threshold for assuming that two variables are equal lowered 
(from 10^-5) to 10^-8.

Fixed a bug in rowChisqStats concerning the p-value computation for constant
variables.


##############
Version 1.0.5

Added man page for simulateSNPcatResponse.

Added function showChanges for showing this file in R.


##############
Version 1.0.4

Added simulateSNPcatResponse (and print.simSNPcatResponse and buildSNPmat) 
for simulating SNP data and a categorical response.


##############
Version 1.0.3

Added snp1norm2Mats for using Manhattan distance in knncatimputeLarge.


##############
Version 1.0.2

Added row names to the output of knncatimputeLarge.

Now pcc2Mats will also work correctly if a row of x1 and a row of x2 are 
identical.


##############
Version 1.0.1

Added (internal function) check4Monomorphism to check for variables only 
showing one level in knncatimpute and knncatimputeLarge.

Added identifyMonomorphism (plus man page) for identifying rows of a matrix 
showing just one level.
